# LongDivisionAlgorithm
The divider.v file is the main file that implements the other three to compute the pen and paper long division

The .tcl files are all tcl scripts that we ran from the tcl terminal. The run.tcl is the script that synthesizes the project in Vivado and gets the LUT counts 

Then there are the reports which have the LUT sizes and timing results of our model
